# Audio Resampler

This program sets the sample rate of all WAV files to 44.1kHz and names the files as "[original name] + [44.1kHz]". E.G. An audio file named "test.wav" will be saved as "test [44.1kHz].wav" after the sample rate has been changed. The orignal audio files are not replaced/deleted. The audio files must be in the put into the "Audio-Resampler-master" folder.

Before running the program, you must do the following:

Step 1:

Create a folder in the "Audio-Resampler-master" folder. Name the folder "sox".

Step 2:
- If you're on Windows, move the files in the "Windows" folder into the "sox" folder.
- If you're on macOS, move the files in the "macOS" folder into the "sox" folder.
